📊 YouTube Data Analysis

This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on YouTube data to understand channel-level trends and why they have so many subscribers.


The analysis covers feature exploration, visualization, and insight generation using Python and popular data analysis libraries.

The project was originally made in July of 2025

# In this project, I:

📥 Worked with a YouTube dataset containing video and channel statistics from the Top Youtubers

📊 Analyzed relationships between these metrics

📈 Visualized trends to uncover meaningful insights about YouTube content performance

The goal was to understand what drives engagement on YouTube videos and to practice real-world data analysis workflows.

# Dataset Description

The dataset includes information such as:

🧑‍💻 Youtuber

👁️ View counts

Video counts

Subscribers 

⏱️ Date Started

# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I used:

Descriptive statistics

Correlation analysis

Visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts)

# 📊 Key Insights & Findings

Some of the insights explored in this analysis include:

🔥 Categories like Music and Entertainment make up a lot of the top Youtubers

📈 There tends to be outliers with this infortmation

📊 Year Started does impact the number of subscriber you have

🧠 High engagement does not always scale linearly with views

These findings help illustrate how audience interaction behaves across different YouTube videos.

# 📉 Visualizations

The project includes visualizations such as:

📊 Distribution plots for views, likes, and comments

🔍 Scatter plots showing relationships between engagement metrics

📈 Bar charts highlighting top-performing videos or channels

Visualizations were created to make trends and patterns easier to interpret.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
